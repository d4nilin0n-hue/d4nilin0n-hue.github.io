# Spotify PS3-Style Revival Web App

A nostalgic recreation of the classic old Spotify interface (circa 2012–2014), built as a fully functional web app using the modern Spotify Web API. Designed to feel like the original desktop/PS3 app: dark theme, genre cards with cover backgrounds, keyboard navigation with arrow keys, PS3-style warning modals, and remote control playback via Spotify Connect.

## Features

- Classic grid of your **top 12 personal genres** (calculated from long-term listening history) with beautiful background images
- **Popular playlists** section based on your top artists/genres
- Full **keyboard navigation** (arrow keys + Enter/Space) – cursor is hidden for that authentic console feel
- Search tracks and play them instantly on any active Spotify device
- Remote control: plays on your phone, computer, console, etc. via Spotify Connect (requires an open Spotify app somewhere)
- PS3-style fade-in warning modal for errors

**Important**: For playback to work, you must have the official Spotify app open and playing (or paused) on at least one device (phone, PC, etc.). This web app acts as a remote controller via Spotify Connect.
